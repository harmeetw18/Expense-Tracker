# Expense-Tracker

Expense Tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application designed to help users manage and track their personal finances. The HTML structure provides the layout for the page, including input fields for entering expenses, categories (e.g., food, rent, entertainment), and the date of the expense. Additionally, there are buttons for adding, editing, or deleting expenses. The CSS is used to style the application, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing design. It might include features like responsive design, clean typography, and intuitive layouts to make it easy for users to interact with the tool.

JavaScript powers the functionality of the tracker. It captures user input, processes the data, and displays it dynamically on the page. For example, when a user adds an expense, JavaScript updates the list of recorded expenses and calculates the total expenses in real-time.
This project is a great way to practice front-end development skills and learn how to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model) and handle user input dynamically using JavaScript.
